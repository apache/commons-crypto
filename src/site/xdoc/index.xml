<section name="Apache Commons Crypto">
    <p>Apache Commons Crypto is a cryptographic library optimized with AES-NI (Advanced Encryption
        Standard New Instructions). It provides Java API for both cipher level and Java stream
        level. Developers can use it to implement high performance AES encryption/decryption with
        the minimum code and effort. Please note that Apache Commons Crypto doesn't implement the
        cryptographic algorithm such as AES directly. It wraps to Openssl or JCE which implement the
        algorithms.

<section name="Features">
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cipher API for low level cryptographic operations.</li>
      <li>Java stream API (CryptoInputStream/CryptoOutputStream) for high level stream
        encyrption/decryption.
      </li>
      <li>Both optimized with high performance AES encryption/decryption. (1400 MB/s - 1700 MB/s
        throughput in modern Xeon processors).
      </li>
      <li>JNI-based implementation to achieve comparable performance to the native C++ version 
          based on Openssl.
      </li>
      <li>Portable across various operating systems (currently only Linux); Apache Commons Crypto loads the
          library according to your machine environment (It looks system properties, os.name and
          os.arch).
      </li>
      <li>Simple usage. Add the crypto-(version).jar file to your classpath.</li>
    </ul>
