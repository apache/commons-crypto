  <title>Apache Commons Crypto: Proposal</title>
 </properties>

 <body>
  
   <section name="Proposal for Apache Commons Crypto Package"><br/>
   <h4>March 24, 2016</h4>
  

  
<subsection name="(0) Rationale">
  <p>
   Providing Java based optimized and high performance cryptographic IO streams for
   the applications who wants to implement the data encryption. It also provides cipher
   level API to use. It does provide the openssl API integration and provide the fallback
   mechanism to use JCE when openssl library unavailable.
  </p>

  </subsection>
<subsection name="(1) Scope of the Package">
  <p>
      This proposal is to create a package of cryptographic IO classes with the integration
      of Openssl library.
      It focuses on AES-NI optimizations mainly and it can be extended to other algorithms
      based on demand from the users later.
  </p>

  </subsection>
<subsection name="(1.5) Interaction With Other Packages">

  <p>
   <em>IO</em> Commons Crypto relies on standard JDK 7 (or later) APIs for production
   deployment and on OpenSSL 1.0.1c devl libraries. It utilizes the JUnit unit testing
   framework, but this is of interest only to developers of the component.
   The functionality provided by Commons Crypto is currently in use by Apache Hadoop
   and Apache Spark, and both of those communities have expressed interest in changing
   their dependency to be on the central Commons Crypto package once it exists.
  </p>

  <p>No external configuration files are utilized.</p>

  </subsection>
<subsection name="(2) Initial Source of the Package">

  <p>
   The initial classes came from the Apache Hadoop.
  </p>

  <p>
   The proposed package name for the new component is <code>org.apache.commons.crypto</code>.
  </p>

  </subsection>
<subsection name="(3)  Required Apache Commons Resources">

  <ul>
   <li>
    Git Repository - New repository <code>commons-crypto</code>
   </li>
   <li>
       Mailing List - Discussions will take place on the general<em>dev@commons.apache.org</em>
       mailing list.
       <br>To help list subscribers identify messages of interest, it is suggested that the message
           subject of messages about this component be prefixed with [Crypto].
       </br>
   </li>
   <li>
       JIRA - New component "Crypto" under the "Commons" project.
   </li>
   <li>
       Confluence FAQ - New category ¡°commons-crypto" (when available).
   </li>
  </ul>
